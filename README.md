# CodSoft_MachineLearning  
Welcome to the repository containing my solutions for the **"Machine Learning Internship"** offered by CodSoft. Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of my completed tasks, showcasing the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the internship.  

## Task - 1 : Movie Genre Classification  
### Objective  
Develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting a movie's genre based on textual information.  

### Techniques  
Utilize advanced text processing techniques, including TF-IDF and word embeddings, along with well-established classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.  

### Dataset  
The project utilizes the [Genre Classification Dataset from IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb). This dataset provides the necessary information for training and testing the genre classification model.
